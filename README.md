# Makita XGT Battery Tester


Basic tester for Makita's line of 40V XGT batteries which retrieves the following information:

  

 - Model
   
  - Charge Count
   
  - Health
   
  - Charge
   
   - Temperature
   
  - Pack Voltage
   
  - Individual Cell Voltages

Can be used to create your own basic tester or as a template for a project of your own, whilst my basic example reports received data via serial it should be easy enough to send this data via bluetooth, show on an LCD display, show on a web page whatever.

WARNING – Build this at your own risk, if assembled incorrectly this may start a fire, damage your micro controller or brick your expensive XGT battery. I take less than 0 responsibility if any of this happens.

I am not a programmer nor am I an electronics engineer, I slapped this together as an academic exercise more than anything else and it is not intended as a turn key project. You should not build this unless you have an understanding of electronics, programming and the risks involved.

## Hardware:
For my example I chose an ESP32-C3, namely because I already had one but also because the ESP32-C3 has 2 hardware uart interfaces and the ability to operate in inverted mode which is a requirement to communicate with these batteries. As well as this the ESP32-C3 also has Bluetooth and WiFi giving multiple options to present the data.

The below circuit was used in conjunction with the ESP32-C3 to interface with the battery. These batteries operate on 5V logic and the ESP32 3.3v so the logic level converter is a must. Note the level shifter used must have a pinout as shown below in order for the circuit to function correctly, the 4 channel "bi directional" type will not work.

The circuit should be connected to your chosen tx / rx pins and the GND / DT pins on the battery as per the picture below:

## Software:

Software is based on existing work by “Malvineous” and data I captured from a genuine Makita battery tester, more info here:

 Assuming you are using an ESP32-C3 to get started edit lines 3, 4 and 5 to match your specific hardware configuration, with nothing connected when the button is pressed you should see the message “"Error Communicating With Battery" printed on the serial console. Once the battery is connected you should see an output similar to the example below. Good luck.
